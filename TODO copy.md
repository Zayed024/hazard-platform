3. **Image Processing**: Add basic image analysis for hazard detection
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket implementation for live data

### Week 3-4: Enhanced User Experience
1. **User Authentication**: Login/signup system
2. **Push Notifications**: Alert system for critical hazards
3. **Multi-language Support**: Hindi and regional language support
4. **Advanced Mapping**: Enhanced geospatial features

### Week 5-6: External Integrations
1. **Social Media Monitoring**: Twitter API integration
2. **SMS Gateway**: Twilio integration for alerts
3. **Weather API**: OpenWeatherMap integration
4. **Government APIs**: Emergency services integration

### Week 7-8: Testing & Optimization
